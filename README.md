# D&D OS VTT

A modern open source baldurs-gate-3 inspired Virtual Tabletop built with PeerJS for networking and PixiJS.

Specifically designed to have a D&D battle engine, automating away some of the annoying parts of D&D - rolling dice, remembering your character effects etc.

Including a custom scripting system, for characters. The battle engine has specific events like "TurnBegin", "TurnEnd", "PlayerStart", "PlayerEnd".
